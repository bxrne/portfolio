# portfolio

My portfolio site based on a template.

I record all my work placements / blog posts / projects here in markdown and it is all served statically by Astro.

Using bun.

## EARS Requirements

- When rendering the site header, the UI shall not display a light/dark theme toggle control.
- When rendering the footer, the email input, subscribe button, and consent checkbox shall use contrasting backgrounds against the footer surface.
- When visitors open the blog index, the posts list shall display a table with date, title, description, and reading time columns, ordered by date.
- When visitors open the projects index, the projects list shall display a two-column grid of metadata boxes with title, date, description, reading time, and demo/repo links.
- When visitors open a blog or project detail page, the post/project title shall render as the primary page heading.

### Definition of Done

- Confirm the header no longer shows a theme toggle control.
- Confirm footer inputs and the consent checkbox are visibly separated from the footer background.
- Confirm the blog table shows date, description, and reading time while sorting by date.
- Confirm the projects list uses a two-column grid of boxes and includes all metadata (date, reading time, description, demo/repo links).
- Confirm blog and project titles render as headings on their detail pages.
