The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc). The methodology is designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web. It is particularly suited to modern cloud platforms, which provide a great environment for deploying and scaling applications.
