Matured my previous kubernetes services, improving simulation testing, metrics, logging and moved application level config to service level config - generalised for different factory systems. Improved reliability by creating backoff systems for external systems. Steered a new integration with IBM Maximo, structured for easy extension and integration with future systems. Developed generalised Canary for IQ/OQ testing of any REST API given its OpenAPI spec with load testing included - reducing dev time significantly.
